A GitHub repository that implements the Vector Field Histogram (VFH) navigation algorithm on a Turtlebot3.

VFH_only.mp4 provides a demo of the VFH in action. VFH provides a (blue) waypoint in obstacle-free space.

VFH_and_DWA.mp4 provides a demo of the VFH and DWA in action. VFH provides a (blue) waypoint in obstacle-free space.
The Dynamic Window Approach (DWA) samples smooth and collision-free paths to the VFH-selected waypoint. The turtlebot 
follows these paths to eventually get to its goal (green arrow).
